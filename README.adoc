# NIA v2

## What

This is the beginnings of v2 of my New Impressions of Africa webapp.

You can see v1 [here](https://github.com/bhlieberman/nouvelles-impressions-a-fric).

I am making a v2 mostly to learn how to use Fulcro, but also because I think the data model of Fulcro fits nicely with the *very* nested structure of NIA.
